        <h2>Day 7: Pretty Much A Crisis</h2>
        <page intro="">
            <p>"Hey McDonalds man, you ever patched a leak?" Let's get to it.</p>

        <page talk-to-owl="">
            <p>For a while you talk to the owl. It seems to ignore you. Suddenly, it cocks its head towards a hollow in an old tree.</p>
            <p>You reach inside, and pull out a mysterious wooden flute.</p>
            <event got-flute=""></event>
            <p>"Hmm, now I've seen everything".</p>

            <p>One thing about yourself that you know for sure - you hate owls/</p>
            <p>"Hey! Owl! You're stupid-looking!"</p>
            <p>The owl cocks its head at you bemusedly.</p>
            <p>What a stupid owl, you laugh.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, the owl swoops down and carries you off. It is a big owl indeed.</p>
            <p><i>You are never seen again.</i>

        </page>
        <page check-tree-out="">
            <p>You walk up to the tree. You reckon it to be mighty old. Maybe a bazillion years or more. You notice a strange carving on the tree.</p>
            <p>The carving depicts a great monster, twenty feet tall or more.</p>
            <p>"Pshh. A huge monster, have you ever heard anything so ridiculous, Smeemog? ... Smee?"</p>
            <p>You turn around, but in fact Smeemog has been eaten by a giant monster.</p>
            <p>The monster devours you as you beg for mercy.</p>
